# artistic-dbms-project
We were asked to make a product/program that uses a database management system for our DBMS project. I made an "Art Management System" called Artistic. It is like a social media site for people creating art. People can upload their art and others can like or comment on it!
This was my first website!
I used google's firebase as the database.
These are the snapshots:)
